# Calculator

A functional on-screen calculator built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Chain Operations**: Perform consecutive calculations without pressing equals after each operation
- **Prevent Overflow**: Results with decimals are rounded to 4 decimal places to prevent display overflow
- **Error Handling**: Division by zero displays an error message, 
- **All Clear Function**: AC button resets the calculator to its initial state
- **Intuitive Operator Handling**: When multiple operators are pressed consecutively, only the last one is used


## Learning Outcomes

- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions through click events
- **CSS Layout**: Creating responsive layouts with Flexbox
- **Integration of Several Languages**: Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional, interactive application
